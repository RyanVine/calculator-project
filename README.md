# calculator-project
A small calculator project utilizing HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript.

I focused on using a map Method to be able to easily call the calculations, forEach loops for the numbers and operators with addEventListeners to watch for the individual buttons and a simple function for the final calculation.
